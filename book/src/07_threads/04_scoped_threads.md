# Scoped threads

All the lifetime issues we discussed so far have a common source:
the spawned thread can outlive its parent.\
We can sidestep this issue by using **scoped threads**.

```rust
let v = vec![1, 2, 3];
let midpoint = v.len() / 2;

std::thread::scope(|scope| {
    scope.spawn(|| {
        let first = &v[..midpoint];
        println!("Here's the first half of v: {first:?}");
    });
    scope.spawn(|| {
        let second = &v[midpoint..];
        println!("Here's the second half of v: {second:?}");
    });
});

println!("Here's v: {v:?}");
```

Let's unpack what's happening.

## `scope`

The `std::thread::scope` function creates a new **scope**.\
`std::thread::scope` takes as input a closure, with a single argument: a `Scope` instance.

## Scoped spawns

`Scope` exposes a `spawn` method.\
Unlike `std::thread::spawn`, all threads spawned using a `Scope` will be
**automatically joined** when the scope ends.

If we were to "translate" the previous example to `std::thread::spawn`,
it'd look like this:

```rust
let v = vec![1, 2, 3];
let midpoint = v.len() / 2;

let handle1 = std::thread::spawn(|| {
    let first = &v[..midpoint];
    println!("Here's the first half of v: {first:?}");
});
let handle2 = std::thread::spawn(|| {
    let second = &v[midpoint..];
    println!("Here's the second half of v: {second:?}");
});

handle1.join().unwrap();
handle2.join().unwrap();

println!("Here's v: {v:?}");
```

## Borrowing from the environment

The translated example wouldn't compile, though: the compiler would complain
that `&v` can't be used from our spawned threads since its lifetime isn't
`'static`.

That's not an issue with `std::thread::scope`â€”you can **safely borrow from the environment**.

In our example, `v` is created before the spawning points.
It will only be dropped _after_ `scope` returns. At the same time,
all threads spawned inside `scope` are guaranteed to finish _before_ `scope` returns,
therefore there is no risk of having dangling references.

The compiler won't complain!
