# Case-by-case behavior

`overflow-checks` is a blunt tool: it's a global setting that affects the whole program.\
It often happens that you want to handle integer overflows differently depending on the context: sometimes
wrapping is the right choice, other times panicking is preferable.

## `wrapping_` methods

You can opt into wrapping arithmetic on a per-operation basis by using the `wrapping_` methods[^method].\
For example, you can use `wrapping_add` to add two integers with wrapping:

```rust
let x = 255u8;
let y = 1u8;
let sum = x.wrapping_add(y);
assert_eq!(sum, 0);
```

## `saturating_` methods

Alternatively, you can opt into **saturating arithmetic** by using the `saturating_` methods.\
Instead of wrapping around, saturating arithmetic will return the maximum or minimum value for the integer type.
For example:

```rust
let x = 255u8;
let y = 1u8;
let sum = x.saturating_add(y);
assert_eq!(sum, 255);
```

Since `255 + 1` is `256`, which is bigger than `u8::MAX`, the result is `u8::MAX` (255).\
The opposite happens for underflows: `0 - 1` is `-1`, which is smaller than `u8::MIN`, so the result is `u8::MIN` (0).

You can't get saturating arithmetic via the `overflow-checks` profile settingâ€”you have to explicitly opt into it
when performing the arithmetic operation.
