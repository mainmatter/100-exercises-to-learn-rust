# `Deref` trait

In the previous exercise you didn't have to do much, did you?

Changing

```rust
impl Ticket {
    pub fn title(&self) -> &String {
        &self.title
    }
}
```

to

```rust
impl Ticket {
    pub fn title(&self) -> &str {
        &self.title
    }
}
```

was all you needed to do to get the code to compile and the tests to pass.
Some alarm bells should be ringing in your head though.

## It shouldn't work, but it does

Let's review the facts:

- `self.title` is a `String`
- `&self.title` is, therefore, a `&String`
- The output of the (modified) `title` method is `&str`

You would expect a compiler error, wouldn't you? `Expected &String, found &str` or something similar.
Instead, it just works. **Why**?

## `Deref` to the rescue

The `Deref` trait is the mechanism behind the language feature known as [**deref coercion**](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Deref.html#deref-coercion).\
The trait is defined in the standard library, in the `std::ops` module:

```rust
// I've slightly simplified the definition for now.
// We'll see the full definition later on.
pub trait Deref {
    type Target;
    
    fn deref(&self) -> &Self::Target;
}
```

`type Target` is an **associated type**.\
It's a placeholder for a concrete type that must be specified when the trait is implemented.

## Deref coercion

By implementing `Deref<Target = U>` for a type `T` you're telling the compiler that `&T` and `&U` are
somewhat interchangeable.\
In particular, you get the following behavior:

- References to `T` are implicitly converted into references to `U` (i.e. `&T` becomes `&U`)
- You can call on `&T` all the methods defined on `U` that take `&self` as input.

There is one more thing around the dereference operator, `*`, but we don't need it yet (see `std`'s docs
if you're curious).

## `String` implements `Deref`

`String` implements `Deref` with `Target = str`:

```rust
impl Deref for String {
    type Target = str;
    
    fn deref(&self) -> &str {
        // [...]
    }
}
```

Thanks to this implementation and deref coercion, a `&String` is automatically converted into a `&str` when needed.

## Don't abuse deref coercion

Deref coercion is a powerful feature, but it can lead to confusion.\
Automatically converting types can make the code harder to read and understand. If a method with the same name
is defined on both `T` and `U`, which one will be called?

We'll examine later in the course the "safest" use cases for deref coercion: smart pointers.
