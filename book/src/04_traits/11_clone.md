# Copying values, pt. 1

In the previous chapter we introduced ownership and borrowing.  
We stated, in particular, that:

- Every value in Rust has a single owner at any given time.
- When a function takes ownership of a value ("it consumes it"), the caller can't use that value anymore.

These restrictions can be somewhat limiting.  
Sometimes we might have to call a function that takes ownership of a value, but we still need to use 
that value afterward.

```rust
fn consumer(s: String) { /* */ }

fn example() {
     let mut s = String::from("hello");
     consumer(s);
     s.push_str(", world!"); // error: value borrowed here after move
}
```

That's where `Clone` comes in.

## `Clone`

`Clone` is a trait defined in Rust's standard library:

```rust
pub trait Clone {
    fn clone(&self) -> Self;
}
```

Its method, `clone`, takes a reference to `self` and returns a new **owned** instance of the same type.

## In action

Going back to the example above, we can use `clone` to create a new `String` instance before calling `consumer`:

```rust
fn consumer(s: String) { /* */ }

fn example() {
     let mut s = String::from("hello");
     let t = s.clone();
     consumer(t);
     s.push_str(", world!"); // no error
}
```

Instead of giving ownership of `s` to `consumer`, we create a new `String` (by cloning `s`) and give 
that to `consumer` instead.  
`s` remains valid and usable after the call to `consumer`.

## In memory

Let's look at what happened in memory in the example above.
When `let mut s: String::from("hello");` is executed, the memory looks like this:

```text
                    s
      +---------+--------+----------+
Stack | pointer | length | capacity | 
      |  |      |   5    |    5     |
      +--|------+--------+----------+
         |
         |
         v
       +---+---+---+---+---+
Heap:  | H | e | l | l | o |
       +---+---+---+---+---+
```

When `let t = s.clone()` is executed, a whole new region is allocated on the heap to store a copy of the data:

```text
                    s                                    t
      +---------+--------+----------+      +---------+--------+----------+
Stack | pointer | length | capacity |      | pointer | length | capacity |
      |  |      |   5    |    5     |      |  |      |   5    |    5     |
      +--|------+--------+----------+      +--|------+--------+----------+
         |                                    |
         |                                    |
         v                                    v
       +---+---+---+---+---+                +---+---+---+---+---+
Heap:  | H | e | l | l | o |                | H | e | l | l | o |
       +---+---+---+---+---+                +---+---+---+---+---+
```

If you're coming from a language like Java, you can think of `clone` as a way to create a deep copy of an object.

## Implementing `Clone`

To make a type `Clone`-able, we have to implement the `Clone` trait for it.  
You almost always implement `Clone` by deriving it:

```rust
#[derive(Clone)]
struct MyType {
    // fields
}
```

The compiler implements `Clone` for `MyType` as you would expect: it clones each field of `MyType` individually and
then constructs a new `MyType` instance using the cloned fields.  
Remember that you can use `cargo expand` (or your IDE) to explore the code generated by `derive` macros.
