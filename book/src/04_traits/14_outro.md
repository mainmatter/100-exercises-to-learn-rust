# Wrapping up

We've covered quite a few different traits in this chapter—and we've only scratched the surface!
It may feel like you have a lot to remember, but don't worry: you'll bump into these traits
so often when writing Rust code that they'll soon become second nature.

Before moving on, let's go through one last exercise to consolidate what we've learned. 
You'll have minimal guidance this time—just the exercise description and the tests to guide you.
