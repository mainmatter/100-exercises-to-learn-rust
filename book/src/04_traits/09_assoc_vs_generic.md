# Generics and associated types

Let's re-examine the definition for two of the traits we studied so far, `From` and `Deref`:

```rust
pub trait From<T> {
    fn from(value: T) -> Self;
}

pub trait Deref {
    type Target;
    
    fn deref(&self) -> &Self::Target;
}
```

They both feature type parameters.  
In the case of `From`, it's a generic parameter, `T`.  
In the case of `Deref`, it's an associated type, `Target`.

What's the difference? Why use one over the other?

## At most one implementation

Due to how deref coercion works, there can only be one "target" type for a given type. E.g. `String` can 
only deref to `str`. 
It's about avoiding ambiguity: if you could implement `Deref` multiple times for a type,
which `Target` type should the compiler choose when you call a `&self` method?

That's why `Deref` uses an associated type, `Target`.  
An associated type is uniquely determined **by the trait implementation**.
Since you can't implement `Deref` more than once, you'll only be able to specify one `Target` for a given type
and there won't be any ambiguity.

## Generic traits

On the other hand, you can implement `From` multiple times for a type, **as long as the input type `T` is different**.
For example, you can implement `From` for `WrappingU32` using both `u32` and `u16` as input types:

```rust
impl From<u32> for WrappingU32 {
    fn from(value: u32) -> Self {
        WrappingU32 { inner: value }
    }
}

impl From<u16> for WrappingU32 {
    fn from(value: u16) -> Self {
        WrappingU32 { inner: value.into() }
    }
}
```

This works because `From<u16>` and `From<u32>` are considered **different traits**.  
There is no ambiguity: the compiler can determine which implementation to use based on type of the value being converted.

## Case study: `Add`

As a closing example, consider the `Add` trait from the standard library:

```rust
pub trait Add<RHS = Self> {
    type Output;
    
    fn add(self, rhs: RHS) -> Self::Output;
}
```

It uses both mechanisms:

- it has a generic parameter, `RHS` (right-hand side), which defaults to `Self`
- it has an associated type, `Output`, the type of the result of the addition

### `RHS`

`RHS` is a generic parameter to allow for different types to be added together.  
For example, you'll find these two implementations in the standard library:

```rust
impl Add<u32> for u32 {
    type Output = u32;
    
    fn add(self, rhs: u32) -> u32 {
      // [...]
    }
}

impl Add<&u32> for u32 {
    type Output = u32;
    
    fn add(self, rhs: &u32) -> u32 {
        // [...]
    }
}
```

This allows the following code to compile:

```rust
let x = 5u32 + &5u32 + 6u32;
```

because `u32` implements `Add<&u32>` _as well as_ `Add<u32>`.

### `Output`

`Output`, on the other hand, **must** be uniquely determined once the types of the operands
are known. That's why it's an associated type instead of a second generic parameter.

To recap:

- Use an **associated type** when the type must be uniquely determined for a given trait implementation.
- Use a **generic parameter** when you want to allow multiple implementations of the trait for the same type, 
  with different input types.
