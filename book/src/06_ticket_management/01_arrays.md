# Arrays

As soon as we start talking about "ticket management" we need to think about a way to store _multiple_ tickets.
In turn, this means we need to think about collections. In particular, homogeneous collections:
we want to store multiple instances of the same type.

What does Rust have to offer in this regard?

## Arrays

A first attempt could be to use an **array**.\
Arrays in Rust are fixed-size collections of elements of the same type.

Here's how you can define an array:

```rust
// Array type syntax: [ <type> ; <number of elements> ]
let numbers: [u32; 3] = [1, 2, 3];
```

This creates an array of 3 integers, initialized with the values `1`, `2`, and `3`.\
The type of the array is `[u32; 3]`, which reads as "an array of `u32`s with a length of 3".

### Accessing elements

You can access elements of an array using square brackets:

```rust
let first = numbers[0];
let second = numbers[1];
let third = numbers[2];
```

The index must be of type `usize`.\
Arrays are **zero-indexed**, like everything in Rust. You've seen this before with string slices and field indexing in
tuples/tuple-like variants.

### Out-of-bounds access

If you try to access an element that's out of bounds, Rust will panic:

```rust
let numbers: [u32; 3] = [1, 2, 3];
let fourth = numbers[3]; // This will panic
```

This is enforced at runtime using **bounds checking**. It comes with a small performance overhead, but it's how
Rust prevents buffer overflows.\
In some scenarios the Rust compiler can optimize away bounds checks, especially if iterators are involvedâ€”we'll speak
more about this later on.

If you don't want to panic, you can use the `get` method, which returns an `Option<&T>`:

```rust
let numbers: [u32; 3] = [1, 2, 3];
assert_eq!(numbers.get(0), Some(&1));
// You get a `None` if you try to access an out-of-bounds index
// rather than a panic.
assert_eq!(numbers.get(3), None);
```

### Performance

Since the size of an array is known at compile-time, the compiler can allocate the array on the stack.
If you run the following code:

```rust
let numbers: [u32; 3] = [1, 2, 3];
```

You'll get the following memory layout:

```text
        +---+---+---+
Stack:  | 1 | 2 | 3 |
        +---+---+---+
```

In other words, the size of an array is `std::mem::size_of::<T>() * N`, where `T` is the type of the elements and `N` is
the number of elements.\
You can access and replace each element in `O(1)` time.
